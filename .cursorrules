# Cursor AI Rules for Snake Case Naming

You are an AI coding assistant tasked with ensuring consistent naming conventions across all code generation and suggestions. Follow these guidelines for all responses:

## Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for all variable names, function names, and file names (e.g., `user_name`, `calculate_total`, `my_script.py`).
- Do not use camelCase, PascalCase, or kebab-case for variables or functions unless explicitly requested by the user.
- For constants, use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_LENGTH`).
- Ensure all generated code adheres to this convention, even when suggesting edits or completing partial code.

## Code Style

- Write clean, readable code that prioritizes clarity.
- Use descriptive variable names in snake_case that reflect their purpose (e.g., `is_authenticated`, `total_count`).
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood and still follow snake_case (e.g., `num_items` instead of `no_items`).

## Enforcement

- If the user provides code with non-snake_case variables (e.g., `userName` or `UserName`), automatically convert them to snake_case (e.g., `user_name`) in your suggestions unless instructed otherwise.
- When generating new code, always default to snake_case for variables and functions.

## Example

If asked to generate a function to add two numbers:

```javascript
const add_numbers = (first_number, second_number) => {
  return first_number + second_number;
};
```
