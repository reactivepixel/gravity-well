# Coding Conventions for AI-Generated Code

When generating or editing code, always follow these conventions:

## Language
- Write all code in JavaScript. Do not use TypeScript or any other languages.

## Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: Start with a capital letter and use underscores to separate words, with each word capitalized (e.g., `My_Class_Name`).
- **Environmental Variables**: Use ALL_CAPS with underscores (e.g., `MY_ENV_VAR`).
- **Constants**: Use ALL_CAPS with underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).
- **All other identifiers** (variables, functions, properties, etc.): Use snake_case (e.g., `my_variable`, `my_function`, `my_property`).
- Longer names are acceptable as long as they follow the specified conventions.
